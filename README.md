## Requirements
You've been provided with the shell of a .NET Core console application with two sample inputs.

Create a console application which outputs both Humphries and Megacorp building supplies.
The information printed should be the ID, item name and price.
The supplies should be shown in a combined list.
The supplies should be ordered from most expensive to least expensive.
All prices must be shown to the nearest cent in AUD based on the exchange rate.

The code should be at a standard you'd feel comfortable with putting in production.

### Source Data
Both humphries.csv and megacorp.json contain lists of construction supplies and labour items.

#### megacorp.json
* ID should be unique
* All prices are in USD

#### humphries.csv
* All prices are in AUD

#### Exchange rate
* The exchange rate is found in appsettings.json.
